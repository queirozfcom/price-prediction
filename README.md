## presentation

- maybe two presentations, one for executives, one for technical audiences

- need to present **both** past behavious as well as current trends and predictions for the future.

#### exploratory data analysis

- what are the main dataset statistics? 

- earliest and most recent data 

- histogram per week/month/day

  - is the data balanced?

- histogram per pay type, per competitor

  - is the data balanced?

- histogram per revenue bucket (buckets of 10,100, 1000?)

  - is the data balanced?

 - outliers?

 - bad data?

## process

The first I felt I needed to do was to look at current frameworks and articles about time-series forecasting to avoid making silly mistakes.


#### first approach

The first approach was very na√Øve, it was just linear regression because sometimes really simple models give good results and are easy and cheap to build (also, you can give some kind of early information to decision-makers while you are still working on a more sophisticated model)

#### second approach

Take sequences of 5 samples (same competitor, same pay time) and try to predict the 5th point with the 4 previous points.

#### targets

- given a product and a price, how much will be sold
 
  - per unit time?

#### differentiating factors (show off?)

 - git (I'm using git)

 - sql

   - maybe load the data into a database and perform a couple of queries to extract aggregation information, etc?

 - clustering

   - products with similar price behaviour?


#### promising packages

- pyflux

- cesium

- rpy2

 - ....

#### overfitting

I shouldn't try too many algorithms

#### seasonality

Acknowledge and explain how it's affected my analysis, what I did to handle that

#### time series

Acknowledge it's a time series (double check)

- ARIMA?

- SARIMA

#### evaluation metrics

 - MAE (relative)

 - RMSE (relative)

- if data is skewed, probably better to use AUC?


#### things I would do if I had more time

- recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are neural-networks that take sequence into account

  - e.g. LSTM?
